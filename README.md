# From Zero to Hero
> The goal is to make you an Android Developer from having no prior knowledge on the Android Framework and programming.

Creating projects as well as mentorship with learning tailored to you will not only develop your hard coding skills, but engineering skills. You will use industry tools like GitHub and project management tools like Trello. Teams vary on what they use, but the process is the same. 

## You will learn

* Java Concepts
* Android Framework
* Best practices
* Popular APIs
* Great libraries
* How to code like a `BOSS`
